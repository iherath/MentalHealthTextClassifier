# Mental Health Text Classifier 
This repository contains a SavedModel file for a text classifier model. It is able to predict whether short texts (sentences) are indicative of drug abuse, alcoholism, depression, or suicide. 

This model was trained on IBM Cloud Object Storage using transfer learning on the [IBM MAX-Text-Sentiment-Classifier](https://github.com/IBM/MAX-Text-Sentiment-Classifier) model. 

Training data was obtained from the [Basic Needs Basic Rights Kenya - Tech4MentalHealth Competition](https://zindi.africa/competitions/basic-needs-basic-rights-kenya-tech4mentalhealth)
